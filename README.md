# machina sperans
Originally conceived as a vehicle for the album release of Kansas City musical artist God's Computer,
Machina Dei 0.0.1 (beta) OS (live physical media only) is soon to be re-imagined and rebuilt as Machina Sperans,
a GNU/Linux based amd64 desktop operating system for individual use. THis repository will host the original project for now,
a Lubuntu 22.04.4 LTS modification, poorly implemented as a live-media only set of restorable disk image files,
consisting of several partitions including a persistence partition, and several amateurish work-arounds for
unfortunately simple reasons, originally distributed on about 50 promotional-quality, 14.7 GiB portable USB "sticks".
If anyone would like to help me by pointing out any obvious things to avoid during the next (conceptual for now) stage,
that would be tight. Machina Sperans will never be licensed, but will have official releases, and a way to
verify the legitimacy, or rather the specific form of illegitimacy, of said releases.
thanks for reading!
